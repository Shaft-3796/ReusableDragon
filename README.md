### How to setup Re Dragon ?

#### Step 1 - register your world :

The plugin when started for the first time will create an configuration file, change your end world name if you have a custom name for it ( default it's world_the_end )

#### Step 2 - save your battle arena :

When started for the first time, the plugin will create 6 files :

RdAreaEasy.rd
RdEntitiesEasy.rd
RdAreaMedium.rd
RdEntitiesMedium.rd
RdAreaHard.rd
RdEntitiesHard.rd

It's your battles areas data. By default, all difficulties will have the same area. Let's now save our areas.

Build your area how you want from and make sure to have ender crystal placed ! Use /rdsave easy to save your easy battle area.

Build new area or keep the same and save the areas for other difficulties with /rdsave medium and /rdsave hard

Now all your areas are saved for each difficulty

#### Step 3 - customise your config file :

Customise your config file with the instructions above every lines
